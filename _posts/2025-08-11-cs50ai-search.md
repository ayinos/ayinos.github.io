# CS50AI Search

Notes from the [Harvard CS50AI](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python) online course.

## Intro
- We would like the AI to be able to search for solutions to some kind a problem.

## Examples of Search Problems
- 15 puzzle game
- tic tac toe game
- a maze
- google maps

## Terminologies

### 1. agent
- e.g.
  - car in google maps
  - person playing the game in 15 puzzle or tic-tac-toe

### 2. state
- configuration
- e.g. configuration of tiles in 15 puzzle

### 3. intial state
- state where agent begins

### 4. actions
- choices that can be made in any given state
- function : actions(s)
  - s : state
  - returns : set of actions valid in the given state 's'
- e.g. in the 15 puzzle game moving tiles -> or <- or up or down

### 5. transition model
- description of what state results from performing any applicable action in any state.
- function : result(s,a)
  - s : state
  - a : action
  - returns : the state we get after performing action 'a' in state 's'

### 6. state space
- the set of all the states we can get from the initial state by any sequence of actions

### 7. goal test
- way to determine whether a given state is a goal state
- e.g. in 15 puzzle, numbers in ascending order or in google maps, state = destination entered by the user.
- some problems may have one goal
- complex problems may have multiple goal states, multiple ways to solve a problem. we may not care which one the AI find as long as it does find.

### 8. path cost
- numerical cost associated with a given path
- ![cs50ai-01search-02-graphwithpathcosts.png](/assets/images/cs50ai-01search-02-graphwithpathcosts.png)
- will only apply for some problems
- does not apply to 15 puzzle since the cost is the same to move the tile

### 9. solution
- sequence of actions that will take us to the goal state from the

### 10. optimal solution
- lowest path cost among solutions
