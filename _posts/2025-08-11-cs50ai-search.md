# CS50AI Search

Notes from the [Harvard CS50AI](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python) online course.

## Intro
- We would like the AI to be able to search for solutions to some kind a problem.

## Examples of Search Problems
- 15 puzzle game
- tic tac toe game
- a maze
- google maps

## Terminologies

| Term                 | Description                                                                                                                     | Function                                                            | Examples / Details                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent**            | Entity that perceives and acts.                                                                                                 |                                                                     | Car in Google Maps, Person playing the game in 15 puzzle or tic-tac-toe            |
| **State**            | Configuration                                                                                                                   |                                                                     | Configuration of tiles in 15 puzzle                                                |
| **Initial State**    | State where the agent begins.                                                                                                   |                                                                     |                                                                                    |
| **Actions**          | Choices that can be made in any given state; returns all valid actions for a given state.                                       | `actions(s)` → set of valid actions in state `s`                    | In 15 puzzle: move tile left, right, up, or down                                   |
| **Transition Model** | Describes what state results from performing a given action in a given state.                                                   | `result(s, a)` → new state after performing action `a` in state `s` |                                                                                    |
| **State Space**      | Set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions.                                                  |                                                                     |                                                                                    |           \ \n v            v\n[D]         [E]\n``` |
| **Goal Test**        | Method to determine whether a state is a goal state. Some problems may have one goal; other complex problems may have multiple. |                                                                     | 15 puzzle: numbers in ascending order, Google Maps: current location = destination |
| **Path Cost**        | Numerical cost associated with a given path; applies only to some problems.                                                     |                                                                     | Does not apply to 15 puzzle since each move costs the same                         |
| **Solution**         | Sequence of actions that will take us from the initial state to the goal state.                                                 |                                                                     |                                                                                    |
| **Optimal Solution** | A solution with the lowest path cost among all solutions.                                                                       |                                                                     |                                                                                    |
